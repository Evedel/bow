Features
==  
- V2 registries support only (secure, selfsigned and insecure, DNS and IP:PORT)
- internal db ([BoltBD](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt)) gives it ability to store info, and as result it responses much faster then after direct api call, and can provide more data
- app can pars, store and show info from registry such as:
 - image layers info:
   - name / tag
   - image size and pushes number
   - upload and push dates
 - image creating commands history
- it is possible to set multiple repositories and watch all registries in one place
- show statistics pretty, draw curves of uploads number and image sizes for tag with respects to dates
- find parent of image, in case, parent in the same repo (it is clickable!)
- show tree-graph of parents for image
- enabled image deletion (registry --version >= 2.4.0)
- __(new)__ API compatibility checks
- __(the newest)__ Bearer token auth support (secure and selfsigned auth servers)
- __(killerfeature)__ Namespace layer and parents graph filters

Image deletion
==
To enable image deletion you need to:  
1. Run your registry with the flag `-e REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED=true`  
Example:  
```
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry \
  -v ./auth:/auth \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd" \
  -e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=Registry Realm" \
  -e REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd \
  -e REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED=true \
  registry:2
```  
2. Set up cron to run garbage collection  
Example:  
`10 * * * * docker exec registry bin/registry garbage-collect /etc/docker/registry/config.yml`  
3. Also be aware, that there is a known [issue](https://github.com/docker/distribution/issues/1939) in docker registry 2.6.2 and earlier. It means, that if you delete an image from a repository, you will not able to push __the exactly same__ image in that repository. To fix it, you will need to perform rebuilding of image with `--no-cache` mode each time or restarting the registry `docker restart registry` once after deletion.

Bearer token auth
==
What is it and how it works see [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/auth/token/).  
Bow was tested to work with [cesanta/docker_auth](https://github.com/cesanta/docker_auth) in [this configuration](develop/devcompose.yml).  

Prospects
==
I can say that this app almost fit my needs, so in all likelihood, soon, I will not improve it hardly, but this is the list of ideas just for case:  
- info for whole repository: size, number of pushes so on so on soon
- add button 'Don't Track', to store repo data but not update it
- add tests for bearer token and for image deletion
